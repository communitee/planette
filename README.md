Life mission management helper application.

**Purpose**

Those who believe in man's free choice will agree with me that a happy and fulfilled life involves planning.
This is for you!

* Kids need to be occupied...all the time...When they aren't, they mess *someone*'s day up...
* Kids need to go to the doctor(routine stuff plus sicknesses)...If they don't, either something nasty happens or *someone*'s conscience starts hurting...more the latter..
* When kids reach a certain age, they just need to play with other kids...that's a good thing for their parents too...*someone* needs to take care of coordinating, pickups etc...

***Someone*** **is me!!!**

Of course, no app can take my kids hiking for me, take them to the doctor, pick them up from a friend or take them to see a play...That would have defeated the pupose of having kids, anyway..
But what an app can surely do is to:

1. Take a doctor's appointment for my kids.
2. Look up suitable family hike's.
3. Coordinate a play date with a parent
4. **Anticipate** and ask me questions **only when needed**


**Components:** 

***Secretary engine -***
* This is where you write down your wishes
* This is the app that helps you define what you want.
* This is the app that helps you define the practical stages to achieve what you want.

***Autoscripts -***
* Many little apps that take all computable tasks of your back.
* Scraping is a big portion here

**Differentiator:**

* Get out the browser/selenium and become GUI automation DSL
* Become a DSL with which anyone can write their ***Autoscript***.
  doing that will allow us to block/query exactly what a script does
