# Communitee > Family

Family management helper application.

**Purpose**

Having a family(kids included of course) is by far the heaviest project I've ever had.
We have 2 kids(ages 2 and 5).

* Kids need to be occupied...all the time...When they aren't, they mess *someone*'s day up...
* Kids need to go to the doctor(routine stuff plus sicknesses)...If they don't, either something nasty happens or *someone*'s conscience starts hurting...more the latter..
* When kids reach a certain age, they just need to play with other kids...that's a good thing for their parents too...*someone* needs to take care of coordinating, pickups etc...

***Someone*** **is me!!!**

Of course, no app can take my kids hiking for me, take them to the doctor, pick them up from a friend or take them to see a play...That would have defeated the pupose of having kids, anyway..
But what an app can surely do is to:

1. Take a doctor's appointment for my kids.
2. Look up suitable family hike's.
3. Coordinate a play date with a parent
4. **Anticipate** and ask me questions **only when needed**
